          "body": "# Problem description\r\n\r\nCurrently when a `poetry install` command is run on a project, which has source stored under `src/project_name`, but a folder named `project_name` exists in the root, the command will fail with `project_name is not a package.` It can be rather hard to determine the root cause, as one might easily overlook the empty folder.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n1. create a new poetry project `poetry new poetry-demo`\r\n2. Move `poetry_demo/__init__.py` to `src/poetry_demo/__init__.py`\r\n3. run `poetry install`\r\n\r\nThe command will fail with the following\r\n```\r\npoetry install\r\nInstalling dependencies from lock file\r\n\r\nInstalling the current project: poetry-demo (0.1.0)\r\npoetry_demo is not a package.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is caused by the presence of poetry_demo folder in the root.\r\n\r\n```\r\ntree -I \".git\" --noreport --charset utf-8 .\r\n.\r\n├── README.md\r\n├── poetry.lock\r\n├── poetry_demo\r\n├── pyproject.toml\r\n├── src\r\n│   └── poetry_demo\r\n│       └── __init__.py\r\n└── tests\r\n    └── __init__.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I remove the  poetry_demo folder, the `poetry install` command succeeds. \r\n\r\n# Resolution\r\n\r\nTo provide more information about the actual root cause of the issue, I have added another validation method to the Factory class. This will output a warning when there is both\r\n- an empty `project_name` folder in the root\r\n- non-empty `src/project_name` folder\r\nThe provided warning message is the following\r\n\r\n```\r\nFound empty directory 'project_name' in project root while the actual package is in 'src/project_name'. This may cause issues with package installation. Consider removing the empty directory.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf there is a better place / method how to alert user to the empty `project_name` folder, I am happy to hear it and adjust my implementation.\r\n\r\n<!-- This is just a reminder about the most common mistakes.

Introduction file and list of best practices.\r\n- `docker-examples/`. Folder with practical examples to get you started. This already comes with two examples, also referenced in the docker-best-practices.md.\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nThis PR is a proposal for adding the translations infrastructure to the pandas web page. \r\n\r\nFollowing the discussion in #56301, we (a group of folks working on the Scientific Python grant) have been working to set up infrastructure and translate the contents of the pandas web site. As of this moment, we have 100% translations for the pandas website into Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese, with other languages available for translation (depending on volunteer translators).\r\n\r\nWhat this PR **does**:\r\n\r\n* Reorganizes web site sources file structure for multilanguage support, with a new \"pt\" folder which, in the future, can hold Brazilian Portuguese translations pulled in from Crowdin.\r\n* Adds a language switcher to the top of the page\r\n* Adds language option to web pages command line builder\r\n\r\nWhat this PR **does not** do:\r\n\r\n* Add actual translations for the full contents of the website. This needs to be done in a follow-up.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a draft, as we are looking for feedback on the approach and appetite for this change. We would love to have more languages added, and we firmly believe having the translations infrastructure may help recruit new translators which will then see their work published on the actual website. We can also work on adding a \"Translations team\" to the pandas website if desired, with data pulled in automatically from Crowdin. \r\n\r\nTo build, this will require the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\npython pandas_web.py pandas/content --target-path build --languages en pt\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to check out other related work, please take a look at https://github.com/scipy/scipy.org/pull/617\r\n\r\nSome of this is still work in progress, and @goanpeca is working on automations to make synchronizing and updating the translations easier- he can also help answer questions on the overall integration with Crowdin.\r\n\r\nAny feedback is appreciated, and we are happy to answer questions and discuss more if needed.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n- [ ] closes #xxxx (Replace xxxx with the GitHub issue number)\r\n- [ ] [Tests added and passed](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/development/contributing_codebase.html#writing-tests) if fixing a bug or adding a new feature\r\n- [ ] All [code checks passed](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/development/contributing_codebase.html#pre-commit).\r\n- [ ] Added [type annotations](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/development/contributing_codebase.html#type-hints) to new arguments/methods/functions.\r\n- [ ] Added an entry in the latest `doc/source/whatsnew/vX.X.X.rst` file if fixing a bug or adding a new feature.\r\n",

This PR ensures that the `_concat_indexes` helper uses the correct dtype-aware construction (`array(..., dtype=...)`) to preserve the original dtype of the first index.\r\n\r\n### Test added:\r\nAdded a test in `pandas/tests/frame/methods/test_concat_arrow_index.py` that covers the preservation of extension dtypes when using `pd.concat` with `keys=` that triggers MultiIndex creation.\r\n\r\nThe test creates two DataFrames with `timestamp[pyarrow]` indices, then concatenates them with `pd.concat(..., keys=...)` and asserts that:\r\n- The resulting index is a `MultiIndex`\r\n- The second level (`levels[1]`) retains the `ArrowDtype('timestamp[us][pyarrow]')` instead of being downgraded to `object`.\r\n\r\nThis ensures the dtype preservation fix is validated and regressed against.\r\n",

To get them from the csv, we can set the same parameter in read_csv, and the original Numpy array will be returned.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to tests in scripts/tests/test_csv.py to see how this is used.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the original issue for more information on the problem definition.\r\n\r\n",
